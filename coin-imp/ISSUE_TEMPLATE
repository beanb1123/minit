This project has nothing to do with `coinimp.com`

What this package does is just the following:

1. Launch a local server that serves a page where CoinImp's Javascript miner is embedded.

2. Launch puppeteer (a headless chrome) pointing to that page.

3. Expose an API that allows you to interact with that miner from node.js (starting, stopping, etc).

The purpose of this package is to allow you to run CoinImp's JavaScript miner from node.js (otherwise it only works on the browser).

If you have an issue with CoinImp's JavaScript miner, or with coinhive.com website, you should read their FAQs and contact them here:

Thanks for reading ^.^ if you do have an issue with this package (have a question, found a bug, feature request) then please do submit it
